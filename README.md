# Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition-Background-Foreground-Seperation
Used Dynamic Mode Decomposition to seperate video clips into dynamic modes, analyze the corresponding modal frequency spectrums, and reconstruct the videos using select dyanmic modes to isolate the background and foreground of the clips. 

See the PDF documentation for details on the DMD method and theory, results, and a discussion on limitations of the method.
