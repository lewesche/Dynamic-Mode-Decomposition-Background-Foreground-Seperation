# Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition-Background-Foreground-Seperation

Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) was performed on two video clips with various amounts of movement. DMD describes the systems, in this case videos, interms of dynamic modes and corresponing frequencies. These dynamic modes and frequencies are determined by deriving an approximation to the nonlinear behaviour of the time dependent system's evolution. The high frequency modes describe portions of the system that change rapidly, and these modes were used to construct the moving foreground. The low frequency modes describe the roughly stationary portions of the videos, and these modes were used to reconstruct the background. 


See the PDF documentation for details on the DMD method and theory, results, and a discussion on limitations of the method.
